# 🧮 Scientific Calculator with DevOps

## 📌 Project Overview

This is a **menu-driven Scientific Calculator** implemented in **Java** with the following operations:

* Square root function → `√x`
* Factorial function → `!x`
* Natural logarithm (base *e*) → `ln(x)`
* Power function → `x^b`

The project is integrated with a **DevOps toolchain** that includes source control, build automation, containerization, continuous integration, and deployment.

---

## 🚀 DevOps Toolchain

This project demonstrates the complete DevOps pipeline:

1. **Source Control** → GitHub repository
2. **Build Tool** → Maven
3. **Testing Framework** → JUnit
4. **Continuous Integration** → Jenkins
5. **Containerization** → Docker
6. **Artifact Repository** → Docker Hub
7. **Configuration Management & Deployment** → Ansible
8. **Execution** → Deployed on local machine via Docker container

## 🛠️ Build & Run Locally (Without Docker)

Make sure you have **Java 17** and **Maven** installed.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Tanish-pat/scientific-calculator.git
cd scientific-calculator
mvn clean package
java -jar target/scientific-calculator-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

---

## 🐳 Run with Docker

If you just want to use the calculator, pull and run from **Docker Hub**:

```bash
docker run -it --rm tanish688/scientific-calculator:1.0
```

This will launch the interactive CLI calculator.

---

## ⚙️ Deploy with Ansible

For automated deployment using Ansible:

```bash
ansible-playbook -i ansible/hosts.ini ansible/deploy.yml
```

This will:

1. Pull the latest image from Docker Hub
2. Stop and remove any existing container
3. Start a fresh container named `scientific-calculator`

You can then attach to it with:

```bash
docker exec -it scientific-calculator java -jar /app/calculator.jar
```

Got it 👍 — your Jenkinsfile has more explicit stages than the earlier summary.
Here’s the **corrected section** for the README that exactly matches your pipeline:

---

## 🔄 CI/CD Pipeline

The pipeline is defined in `Jenkinsfile` and performs the following stages:

1. **Checkout** → Pulls code from GitHub (`main` branch).
2. **Build & Test** → Runs Maven inside a container to compile the code and execute JUnit tests.
3. **Prepare Docker Images** → Ensures the base image (`openjdk:17-jdk-alpine`) is pulled.
4. **Docker Build** → Builds a Docker image for the calculator application.
5. **Docker Push** → Pushes the image to Docker Hub using stored credentials.
6. **Deploy with Ansible** → Runs the Ansible playbook (`deploy.yml`) to deploy the container.
7. **Verify Deployment** → Confirms the `scientific-calculator` container is running.

This ensures a complete **CI/CD workflow**: from source code changes → tested build → Docker image → deployment → verification.

## ✅ Example Run

```
=== Scientific Calculator ===
1. Square root (√x)
2. Factorial (!x)
3. Natural log (ln x)
4. Power (x^b)
5. Exit
Choose an option: 1
Enter number: 12
Result: 3.4641016151377544
```
